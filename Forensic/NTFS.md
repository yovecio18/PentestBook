**Master File Table (NTFS)**
MFT is a table used by NTFS file system to track records about all files on the fs, as size,name,creation date etc.

## How to handle?
As you undertand this is not a disk/fs more like a table so you can start by using this to parse all the content into a CSV file:

## Take it further(Windows)
You may try to use this in a windows environment to parse the whole MFT table and re-create the file structure, recover data mm. This tool is very good but slow, it might take hours to parse big files so be aware of that!
