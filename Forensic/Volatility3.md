**Volatility3 Tips&Tricks**
Here I will summon some tipsandtricks that can be used together with Volatility3 as it's totaly different from Volatility2 as it has been totally rewritten.

## How to install?
```
git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3.git
cd volatility3
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Symbols
Next you need to install the appropriate symbols archive in order to use all the functions:
https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/windows.zip
https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/mac.zip
https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org/volatility3/symbols/linux.zip

Unzip the archive as it is in **/volatility3/volatility/symbols** 
OBS: Use only the symbols you need, the SW is extremely slow so be aware to keep it simple!
