SAML aka Security Assertion Markup Language is another SSO methodology that is used to gain seamless authentication between several external systems while still mantain SSO which makes it very useful to avoid 
login between systems.

# How does it work?
1)User access an application
2)The application redirects the user's browser to the Identity provider(IDP) for authentication
3)Once authenticated(Email+password from the user) in the IDP, sends back a XML based code with Email+password+x509 cert to the Service Provider(SPD)
4)The Service Provider(SPD) winch holds a certificate decrypt the encrypted XML response and check Certificate fingerprint for authenticity
5)The SPD send finally the authentication back to user and redirects to the application

# How does it look like?
