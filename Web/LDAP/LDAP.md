We will go thru some basic operands/operations that support in order to understand better how to work with LDAP Injections.

### Operands
```
Equality 	= 	(name=Kaylie) 	Matches all entries that contain a name attribute with the value Kaylie
Greater-Or-Equal 	>= 	(uid>=10) 	Matches all entries that contain a uid attribute with a value greater-or-equal to 10
Less-Or-Equal 	<= 	(uid<=10) 	Matches all entries that contain a uid attribute with a value less-or-equal to 10
Approximate Match 	~= 	(name~=Kaylie) 	Matches all entries that contain a name attribute with approximately the value Kaylie
```


### AND/OR/NOT 
```
(Remember that LDAP supports several condition in one &((cond1)(cond2)(cond3)))
And 	(&()()) 	(&(name=Kaylie)(title=Manager)) 	Matches all entries that contain a name attribute with the value Kaylie and a title attribute with the value Manager
Or 	(|()()) 	(|(name=Kaylie)(title=Manager)) 	Matches all entries that contain a name attribute with the value Kaylie or a title attribute with the value Manager
Not 	(!()) 	(!(name=Kaylie)) 	Matches all entries that contain a name attribute with a value different from Kaylie
```


### TRUE OR FALSE
```
Name 	Filter
True 	(&)
False 	(|)
```


### Searches
```
(name=*) 	Matches all entries that contain a name attribute
(name=K*) 	Matches all entries that contain a name attribute that begins with K
(name=*a*) 	Matches all entries that contain a name attribute that contains an a
