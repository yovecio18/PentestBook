### JSON HTTP Request structure:
```
{
	"key" : "value"
}
```

### Check Token type:
https://jwt.io/


### Use Bearer token in BURP/CURL:
```
"Authorization: bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```
(Where bearer is the type and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX is the actual JWT token)
Example:
```
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
date: Thu, 16 Feb 2023 18:49:00 GMT
server: uvicorn
content-length: 169
content-type: application/json
Connection: close

{"detail":[{"loc":["body","email"],"msg":"field required","type":"value_error.missing"},{"loc":["body","password"],"msg":"field required","type":"value_error.missing"}]}
```
From the example we see that the HTTP POST request in JSON format is expecting 2 values in the body:
```
		{"loc":["body","email"],"msg":"field required"
and 
		{"loc":["body","password"],"msg":"field required"
```
As we see the body is expecting email and password as HTTP data shipped in JSON structure(see first).
