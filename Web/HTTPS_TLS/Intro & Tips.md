# Compression
As the word suggest we can see what is all about, basically it compressed the request to make it faster.
### How to identify in HTTP?
From response headers:  **gzip, compress, or deflate**
### How to identify in TLS?
Fire-up Wire-shark and go to the **"Client Hello" --> Compression Methods** (this is the method supported by the client). 
But who decide is the server go to **"Server Hello" --> Compression Methods** (this is the method chosen by the server)


# HTTP Encryption states:
```
1)encryption-at-rest= data is encrypted at the end stage(aka) encrypted when on disk.
2)encryption-in-transit= data is encrypted before sending and decripted when receiving aka HTTPS.
3)end-to-end= data is fully encrypted from point A to B so that no one can decrypt it!
```


# SSL
Obsolete and weak for today's standards! Versions:
```
    SSL 1.0: This was the initial version of SSL. It was never released to the public due to serious security flaws.
    SSL 2.0: This was the first SSL version that became widely used. It was released in 1995. However, it suffered from multiple serious specification flaws that made it impractical to use in some cases and susceptible to cryptographic attacks.
    SSL 3.0: This was the last version of SSL. It is a full redesign of the 2.0 version that fixed the specification flaws. However, from today's perspective, it relies on deprecated cryptographic algorithms and is vulnerable to a variety of attacks.
```


# TLS
Upgrade over SSL that guarantees confidentiality, integrity & authenticity of data, archived by using **sym/asym** encryption protocols and MACs(Message Authentication Codes). 
```
    TLS 1.0: This was the first version of TLS and was released in 1999. It was based on SSL 3.0 and included many of the same features as SSL, but with additional security enhancements.
    TLS 1.1: This version of TLS was released in 2006 and introduced several important improvements to the protocol, including support for new cryptographic algorithms and protection against attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks (aka On-Path Attacks).
    TLS 1.2: This version of TLS was released in 2008 and introduced further security enhancements, including support for stronger cryptographic algorithms and better protection against attacks. It also introduced new features such as the ability to negotiate the use of compression during the handshake process.
    TLS 1.3: This is the latest version of TLS, released in 2018. It includes significant improvements to the protocol, including faster performance, stronger encryption, and better protection against attacks. It also includes a simplified handshake process and the ability to negotiate the use of encryption during the handshake process.

# Best practices
### Allowed version
```
Only TLS 1.2 + TLS 1.3.
Deny SSL 2.0, 3.0, TLS 1.1 and 1.2.
```
### Allowed ciphers
```
    do not offer any NULL cipher suites that do not offer encryption
    do not offer any EXPORT cipher suites that only offer weak encryption
    preferably use cipher suites that offer PFS. These are all TLS 1.3 cipher suites and the ECDHE and DHE cipher suites in TLS 1.2
    preferably use cipher suites in GCM mode over cipher suites in CBC mode

*ssl.conf* = SSLCipherSuite HIGH
*ngin.conf* = ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305;
```

(Check for Cyphers, TLS used for footprinting. Just give the URL and it will check for TSL, SSL, known CVE, etc)
