A useful method to combat the SSL Stripping aka downgrade to HTTP is to use the Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) headers.
This header will not defend from stripping before the "first" request to a page, but as soon it will be surfed the first time the header will be in place and tell to the browser for how long it need to keep the HTTPS version
and not downgrade back to HTTP. Think it like a TTL for DNS records..

# How to identify?
The first time we surf to a https website example the https://www.google.com we receive the following response:
```
HTTP/2 200 OK
Date: Thu, 29 Dec 2022 15:15:38 GMT
Expires: -1
Cache-Control: private, max-age=0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000

<SNIP>
```
The "max age" is defined in second and tells the browser for how long to block all downgrade request to this site and prefer the HTTPS over the insecure one. This will block all the HTTP request definitely.
