# SSL3.0 Padding 
In a SSL3.0 the padding works out with 2 concepts, the padding bytes can be any value, the last byte must be the size of the padding bytes without the whole size.
Example:
If we have a block size of 8 bytes and our message is **DE AD BE EE** we will need to add 3 padding bytes(00 x3) plus the size of the padding itself resulting:
**DE AD BE EE 00 00 00 03**(03 because we added 3 bytes of padding to reach 8bytes)

# Attacks types:
There are 2 attack types that targets specific **SSL3.0.**

### POODLE Attack (Existing CBC mode)
To exploit it, an attacker forces the victim to send a specifically crafted request that contains a full block of padding. 
This means that the attacker already knows the last byte of the padding block as it is the size of the padding. The attacker intercepts the cipher-text and changes data in the last block. 
If this results in a different padding size, the web server interprets data differently, resulting in a MAC error, since SSL 3.0 uses a MAC to provide integrity protection. 
However, if the padding size remains correct, the web-server computes the MAC correctly and no MAC error is thrown. 
Just like in a textbook padding oracle attack, this leaks an intermediary result of the CBC-mode to the attacker, enabling him to compute a byte of the plain-text. 
Applying this attack recursively allows for the decryption of entire cipher-text blocks.

### BEAST Attack (Theoretical)
The BEAST attack discovered in 2011 works similarly. 
The attacker intercepts a correct cipher-text and then sends a crafted cipher-text to the target server. 
This allows the attacker to deduce information about a plain-text block. However, depending on the block size, a block might be sufficiently large to make a brute-force attack on a whole block infeasible. 
Thus, BEAST additionally relies on a technique that changes the original plain-text slightly by injecting additional characters to ensure that only one byte in the resulting plain-text block is unknown. 
This allows the attacker to brute-force the plain-text byte by byte.
However, BEAST is a theoretical attack due to the nature of its exploitation. Exploiting it in practice is rather difficult. 
That is because BEAST needs to bypass the same-origin policy that modern web browsers implement to work properly. 
It therefore requires a separate attack, a same-origin policy bypass, for practical exploitation, making the risk of a real-world attack small.

### Prevention:
POODLE can be prevented by disabling the use of **SSL 3.0** entirely. Even if a web server supports newer TLS versions, a client might be able to force the use of SSL 3.0 by manipulating handshake messages. 
Therefore, **SSL 3.0** should be completely disabled and not be supported even for legacy reasons.
For instance, disabling **SSL 3.0** in the **Apache2** web server can be achieved using the following directive:
