The eval() function in JS is very dangerous as it particularly prone towards various injections if code is not successfully sanitized before passed to itself, as you understand this can cause various nefarious actions like command injection and so on...
The function is used to evaluate a passed item(string or other) into executed code!

### Vulnerable Functions
```
eval("console.log('test')");
new Function("console.log('test')")();
setTimeout("console.log('test')", 1000);
setInterval("console.log('test')", 1000);
```

### Example
If we have this as code: 
```
eval("var i = '" + input + "'");
```
We can pwn it sending something like
```
'; console.log('injection'); '    
```
resulting into 
```
eval("var i = ''; console.log('injection'); ''");
```
(Basically we are injecting **'** to close the first quotation mark and then attach our malicious code)
From IDE it will be executed as:
```
var i = "";
console.log("injection");
("");
```
