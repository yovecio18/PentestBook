# Code Review
If you need to review your JS code and check that is written with the right code that are secure you can paste your code into:
https:### snyk.io/code-checker/
Chose the Language and it will show you possible flaws in the code!


# NPM Tips
### How to install packages from a source code
```
npm install
```
### How to run a istance
```
npm run dev
```
### How to check for vulns in packages
```
npm audit
```
### How to check for vulns in code
```
npm install safe-eval -S
npm audit report
```


# Useful tools
Here you might find useful tools used to obfuscate or manipulate JS code so it is more difficult to read.
### Minifier
(basically it removes the identation as spaces, new lines and so on to make it shorter)
https://javascript-minifier.com/

### Packer 
(will obfuscate the code to make it more difficult to read)
http://beautifytools.com/javascript-obfuscator.php
### Obfuscators 
(this will be more hardcoded)
https://obfuscator.io/                          
(this exaple can use B64 for encoding)
https://jsfuck.com/                             
(this will use brainfuck to encode the code)
https://utf-8.jp/public/aaencode.html           
(this is same fashion will use A's to encode the code)    
### Beautifier 
(this will do the inverse, also beautify a packet/minified code)
https://beautifier.io/
### De-obfuscators 
(This will de-obfuscate JS code that have been packed or obfuscated)

(*This is better as can choose several options for de-obfuscations*)

# JS Objects
Objects in Java script are what classes are in C#. It basically a custom variable type that can hold several characteristics called **"Propeties."**
Object Example:
```
module = {name: "Web Attacks", author: "21y4d", tier: 2}
```
Call a Object:
```
module.name
```
Edit properties:
```
module.difficulty = "medium"
```

# Prototypes
Prototypes are specific functions associated with a object(class) which are not defined in the object itself but instead are pre-inherited as standard functions.
Example (will print the object as a string type!):
```
module.toString()
"[object Object]"
```
List prototypes:
```
module.__proto__
```
Shadowing(aka overwrite a default inherited prototype):
```
module.toString = function() {return "This is the HTB Academy module: " + this.name;}

--This will overwrite the default toString() action
```


# Bypass proto blacklist
The main way we can pollute a prototype is ny using __proto__
But there is another alternative which gives the same result which is:
```
method.constructor.prototype (ex: User.constructor.prototype)
```
OBS: This is useful if a blacklist only blocks __proto__ and not `XXXXX.constructor.prototype`
