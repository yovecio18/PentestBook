**How to Reverse/Decompile Java files**
Many methods are available to do the same task but it might happen to get some diffs in the code from decompilation so try several to compare.

## Via jd-gui(easy)
Just open the jar file via Jd-gui and save the source code exported.

## Via Jadx-gui(easy)
Just open the jar file via Jadx-gui and save the source code exported.

## Via Fernflower(medium)
```
git clone https://github.com/fesh0r/fernflower.git
cd fernflower
./gradlew build
java -jar fernflower.jar BlueBird-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar src
jar -xf BlueBird-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
**OBS:** if gradle fails install
```
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
sudo update-java-alternatives --set /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.17.0-openjdk-amd64
```
