# X-Forward-header Bypass
### What is?
//HTTP VERB Tamper:
1)Start by shipping **/OPTION** to check which methods are allowed by the server: 
```
Date: Wed, 13 Mar 2024 09:56:51 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Allow: GET,POST,PUT,TRACK,OPTIONS
```
2)Iterate thru all of them until you find the one that works for you!


## Common bypass headers: 
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin
Client-IP
Forwarded
Forwarded-For
Forwarded-For-IP
Origin
X-Client-IP
X-Custom-IP-Authorization
X-Forwarded
X-Forwarded-By
X-Forwarded-For
X-Forwarded-For-Original
X-Forwarded-Host
X-Forwarder-For
X-Originating-IP
X-Remote-Addr
X-Remote-IP
CF-Connecting-Ip
X-Real-IP
True-Client-IP
```

## Example:
I was doing a CTF lab and upon a HTTP verb tampering exercise the web-server answered back with some strange headers:
```
TRACK HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 12 Aug 2023 15:30:42 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 172.18.0.1
Content-Length: 1
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Via: 1.1 dev.inlanefreight.local
Connection: close
```
Now that **X-Custom-IP-Authorization** is pointing to a internal IP to the web-server and not accessible to me. To bypass we could use something in our request.
Reference: https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tutorials/using-match-and-replace
And a payload like: **X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1**
And this should do the trick to bypass the eventual login portal!
