**Host Headers Crash course**
These are mandatory part of a HTTP request and tells to the back-end that will receive a request on with host/vhost to send request the data to. This is particularly important where you find web-servers(back-end) that serves several websites(aka vhosts) so that the request from client reaches the right back-end.

# HOST Header config example
This is an example of a VHOST config in Apache:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/testapp"
    ServerName testapp.htb
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/anotherdomain"
    ServerName anotherdomain.org
</VirtualHost>
```

# What are these headers vulnerable to?
Injections! This is because the web-server trusts the host headers as it is and no sanitation going on.
**REMEBER**: these attacks are possible only if front-end uses absolute addresses, using relative will totally invalidate this.


# Prevention
**Host headers attack prevetion**
1)Check always for HOST passed in the back-end, do not think that no user will ever try to write something bad.
2)Blacklist/Whitelist of VHOSTS so no one can guess with *testVALID*
3)Block possible esoteric **notation(hex,dec.short,ipv6 etc) for 127.0.0.1/localhost** inputted into host header during request phase
4)Rely on relative path in reflected values in response body as much as possible as these attacks that target Host HEADERS won't work in that case!
5)Deny use of override headers to bypass base host header
