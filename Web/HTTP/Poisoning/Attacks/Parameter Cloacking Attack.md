**Parameter Cloaking Webcache Attack**
This is a particular attack that targets Webcaches in order to poison them with our malicious payloads!

## How to identify?
Check the response from the back-end and if is Python Bottle before 0.12.19 then it's vulnerable.

## How does it work?
Let's take into examinations this string: `/admin/users.html?sort_by=role&utm_source=x;sort_by=MALICIOUS`
We know that the victim visits (`/admin/users.html?sort_by=role`) that's why we want to poison the cache and cache on this base URL out malicious payload.
Let's ananlyze what happens:
1)Bottle(Webserver): see 3 separate values (`"sort_by=role", "utm_source=x", "sort_by=MAILICOUS"`) and by default Bottle prioritize the last shipped value.
2)Webcache(Backend): see it as only 2 parameters (`"sort_by=role", "utm_source=x;sort_by=MALICIOUS"`) and saves the web-cache on the first value.
In real-life scenario the web-cache will cache only the first param "sort_by=role" and that is where the victim will surf and get the XSS payload from. In this example we found that sort_by will reflect our XSS payload and this will be cached into cache and successively spit back to the victim!
