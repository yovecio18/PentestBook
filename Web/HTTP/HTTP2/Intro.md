A simple HTTP/2 request have the following headers:
```
    :method: the HTTP method
    :scheme: the protocol scheme (typically http or https)
    :authority: similar to the HTTP Host header
    :path: the requested path including the query string
```
	
## Example request:
```
:method GET
:path /index.php
:authority http2.htb
:scheme http
```

## HTTP1 vs HTTP2
The main difference are:
```
HTTP/1= older, slower and string based
HTTP/2= newer, faster as it is multiplex and is binary based
```
OBS: HTTP/2 doesn't support chunked mode aka TE.
