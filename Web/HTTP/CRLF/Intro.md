# CRLF
Stands for **CR(Carriage return) and LF(Line Feed)** are set of instructions used for go to begin of the line(CR) and go to new line(LF).
Chaining together both forms a **CRLF** that can be used in injection attacks to perform malicious tasks if the back-end application is not sanitizing the user inputs.
```
CR= /r or %0D in URL encoding
LF= /n or %0A in URL encoding
```
