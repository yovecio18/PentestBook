## SSTI manual identification
1)Start by identifying if the SSTI is present (if you see 49 in the reflected value on the HTML page then you are Gucci)
```
{{7*7}}
${7*7}
<%= 7*7 %>
${{7*7}}
#{7*7}
*{7*7}
```


2)Next if passed the step 1 then check on the SSTI Legend(picture) and try following steps
```
{{7*'7'}}
```

3)If it passed the step 2 then you are either if front of TWIG or Jinja2 template engine
4)From  here check in https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection#server-side-template-injection

OBS:Sometimes the manual fuzzing might fail or give results that are not same as the picture in legends then you have to use SSTIMap or old fashion brute-force.
EX: a application passes the first test `{{7*7}} = 49` then we test the second following as standard `{{7*'7'}}'=7777777` ok here the result is not matching the standard. So searching the result shows that this is Tornado: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection#tornado-python
