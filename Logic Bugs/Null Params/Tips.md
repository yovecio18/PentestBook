# Introduction
### What are null-safe languages?
Modern languages that support null-safety also ensure that variable that are NULL (var count; aka not initialized) 
can't be accessed.

### Example
A developer might perform a validation check that value isn't null before getting accessed!
```
if (count === null) or if !(count)
```

### NullSafe Languages
```
    TypeScript
    Rust
    C#
    Swift
    Kotlin
    Dart
```


### How to identify Null Bugs?
1)Nullsafe languages: review uses of non-null assertion operator (!), and see if it could lead to a null-reference error.
2)(NON)-Nullsafe languages: look for uninitialized variables or ones that get assigned null afterward.

After you identified the potential variables check for null validity checkes ex. if **(count !== null)**
If we can determine a case that may bypass these checks, 
then we can shortlist this variable for further local testing and code reviews to determine whether it can lead to a potential logic bug.


### JS NullSafe Pitfalls

For JS unfortunately is the most difficult Nullsafe language to identify bugs is because the JS can have:
```
**NULL= running typeof returns void object**
**NaN(aka Not a number) = running typeof returns number**
**Undefined= running typeof returns undefined**
```


Example: JS will parse NULL= 0(INT) and this might be an issue if a IF(int >= 0) this will be a TRUE and totally change the logic of the code.

Example2:
```
const { count } = req.body;
if (!count) {
  throw new Error();
}
```
In this case we can bypass this by sending a string count=0
This is because JS treat **0=FALSE** to be if not false (i.e. if true), which would pass the if condition.

### How to find NULL(not initialized) vars in JS Code?
You need to find not initialized variables like **let XXX; var YYY;**
Search Regex: 
```
(let|var) [A-Za-z]*
```

### JS Null params
When you have access to the code of an application(WhiteBox) then you can test following:
```
id:null
id:"null"
id:"0" (converting from string to integer should result in zero)
id:0
id:-1
id:-1
Also try to ommitt the ID from the request.
```

Playing around should invoke the Null request and make the app bypass/logic but also crash sometimes.
