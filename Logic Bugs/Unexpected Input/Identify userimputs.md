## How to identify user input forms?
If you have access to the the code(Example):

1)Open the source code in VSCode or similar
2)Open the **/controller** function
3)Search in the forlder for (**req.body & req.params**) for all the user input field.
```
Alternatively use REGEX: (req.body)+|(req.params)
```

OBS: This is particularly useful if you are searching for vulnerable function that uses loose/dynamic variables and can be targeted with unintended params.
