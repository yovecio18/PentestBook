As the title is self explanatory, this attack happens when we have NoSQL where it is vulnerable to JS injections where we circumvent.

# Case scenario
Let's take into consideration the following app that uses a 'where' on the auth check:
.`find({$where: "this.username == \"" + req.body['username'] + "\" && this.password == \"" + req.body['password'] + "\""});`
As you see it uses the where to check all records from the DB that matches the username/password from the POST request BODY without applying any sanitation on user input.

//How to exploit:
Here we can use the JS to guess the password with the query in the username:" `|| (this.username.match('^a.*')) || ""=="`
This will be gradually added until we find the desired user flag!
