This tool can be used to connect to the Win-RM directly from Kali, emulating the Powershell Remoting.


## Tips and tricks
By default you can login via password, password-less(hash) but also via Kerberos tickets. 
If you will ever need to login via kerberos ticket you need to follow this guide.

- Sync your time with DC time
```
rdate -n <dc_ip>
```

- Point to the kerberos CCACHE file
```
export KRB5CCNAME=/home/millycash/Downloads/Infiltrator/m.harris.ccache
```

- Setup the realm in **/etc/krb5.conf** to match something similar
```
[libdefault]
        default_realm = INFILTRATOR.HTB

[realms]
        INFILTRATOR.HTB = {
                kdc = dc01.infiltrator.htb
                admin_server = dc01.infiltrator.htb
        }

[domain_realm]
        infiltrator.htb = INFILTRATOR.HTB
        .infiltrator.htb = INFILTRATOR.HTB
```

- Now you can enjoy a connection via Kerberos(you need to provide the FQDN of the DC and the domain name as well, username can be ommitted as it is fetched via ticket)
```
evil-winrm -i dc01.infiltration.htb -r infiltration.htb -u M.Harris
```
