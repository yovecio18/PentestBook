## How to Sign binary/executable files in windows?
Imagine you are inn a situation where there is a **Applocker.exe** policy that enforces that all the exe/msi need to be signed before running?

**WINDOWS REQUIRED**
1)Find a valid signing certificate(`required the Code Signing (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3) permission`)
2)Export it so you have the private key as well
3)Get the sign tools locally

4)Sign it
```
signtool sign /f MyCert.pfx /t http://timestamp.digicert.com /fd SHA256 MyFile.exe 
```
5)If the app-locker forces that the files need to be on a secure path consider this ones:
```
C:\Windows\System32\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys
C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color
C:\Windows\Tasks
C:\windows\tracing
```
