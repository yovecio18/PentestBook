## AS-REP Roasting

| Don't set users with Kerberos pre-authentication disabled. Some service accounts may require it (older protocols), but enable pre-authentication for all accounts where possible. |
| Ensure the use of strong encryption algorithms with Kerberos. Move away from RC4.                                                                                                 |
| Protect and monitor Service Accounts with strong passwords and watch logs for unusual activity from these accounts (access files or resources not commonly utilized).             |

## Kerberoasting
|                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Using long and complex passwords for your service accounts is critical. A more complex password will make cracking exponentially harder.                                                                   |
| Utilize Group Managed Service Accounts to maintain and secure your services. GMSA will handle password management and rotation for those services. Password rotation will happen every 30 days by default. |
| Limiting the privileges of service accounts. ( not placing service accounts in domain administrators, for example )                                                                                        |
| Rotate the KRBTGT service account password at least every 180 days. This action can invalidate any previous tickets acquired and in use by attackers.                                                      |

## Delegation Abuse
|   |
|---|
|Where possible, disable Unconstrained Delegation.|
|Placing users and service accounts into the Protected Users Group where possible.|
|Using the `Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated` setting for any accounts that do not require delegation.|
|Utilizing the principle of least privileges as much as possible. Locking down access permissions, security groups and user/service accounts can go a long way to protecting against these attacks and many more.|

## Golden Ticket
|   |
|---|
|Implement a least privilege access model|
|Limit the number of admin accounts and make them separate non-interactive accounts|
|Do not expose services such as RDP to the world|
|Utilize Multi-factor authentication on implementations such as OWA and VPNs|
|Endpoint Detection and antivirus can go a long way to helping prevent and detect tools like Mimikatz and the misuse of TGTs|

## Silver Ticket
|   |
|---|
|Ensure service accounts have strong passwords with a complexity of 25 or more characters|
|Utilize Managed Service Accounts and ensure passwords rotate regularly|
|Do not place service accounts within privileged groups like domain administrators|
|Limit the permissions service accounts have to only what is required for them to function|

## Pass-the-Ticket
|   |
|---|
|Monitor events that create and kill processes|
|Check any users requesting new TGTs or TGSs outside of normal operations (before tickets expire, not at a restart, etc.).|
|Privileged identity management (minimize the number of admins and how those accounts are used).|
|Monitor named and anonymous pipes used for direct interaction with the host using tools such as [Pipelist](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pipelist) from the Sysinternals suite or [Pipe Monitor](https://ioninja.com/plugins/pipe-monitor.html).|
