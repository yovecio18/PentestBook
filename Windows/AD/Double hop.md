### What is exactly?
There's an issue known as the "Double Hop" problem that arises when an attacker attempts to use Kerberos authentication across two (or more) hops.
Kerberos tickets should not be viewed as passwords. They are signed pieces of data from the KDC that state what resources an account can access. 
When we perform Kerberos authentication, we get a "ticket" that permits us to access the requested resource (i.e., a single machine). 
On the contrary, when we use a password to authenticate, that NTLM hash is stored in our session and can be used elsewhere without issue.


### Bypass method1 
Connect to the machine1 ex via EvilWin-rm or PSRemoting
```
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
get-domainuser -spn
```
(This is just a test query, this should fail cause it misses the Kerberos tickets in this session)
```
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '!qazXSW@' -AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm', $SecPassword)
```
(This creates a new Credentials object with same credentials from user used from beginning)
```
klist
```
(now it should return a list with session token from previous step)


### Bypass method2
Connect to the machine how you want
```
Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name backupadmsess -RunAsCredential DOMAIN\USERNAME
```
```
Restart-Service WinRM
```
(Saves a PSRemote Config session with users token)
```
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm -ConfigurationName  backupadmsess
```
(Connect again to same machine but this time using the session config with user token)
