If you need to work with the AD to do the most of the stuff you have 2 ways to make it work.

1)From Windows(https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit): 
```
Import-Module .\Powerview.ps1
```
Enjoy!

2)From Linux(https://github.com/aniqfakhrul/powerview.py):
```
powerview range.net/lowpriv:Password123@192.168.86.192 [--dc-ip 192.168.86.192] [-k]     
```
Enjoy
