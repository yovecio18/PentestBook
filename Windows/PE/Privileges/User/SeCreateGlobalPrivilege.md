if you find that a local Windows user have a specific permission on the token: **SeCreateGlobalPrivilege**
This mean the user basically can create global objects for the session like GPOs and so on.
Basically you want to run this tool: https://github.com/itm4n/FullPowers
Upon running the tool locally it should restore the tokens and enable the **SeImpersonatePrivilege**.
When you have gained the **SeImpersonatePrivilege** then you can use **Printspoofer** or **Godpotato** to get a NT system.

**REMEBER**: This tool should be executed as LOCAL SERVICE or NETWORK SERVICE only; running it from a normal user will not work and give you XML error on scheduled task creation. 
EXAMPLE: Get a Revshell from a PHPwebshell directly from a XAMPP server, that should be enough to get a shell as NT/NetworkService
