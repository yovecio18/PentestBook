Without getting to much into buzzwords we can guess what this membership allows you to do. It's literally self explanatory.

### Check Membership
```
net localgroup "Event Log Readers"
```

### Useful tips&tricks
```
wevtutil qe Security /rd:true /f:text | Select-String "/user"
```
(Search for Logins events)

```
wevtutil qe Security /rd:true /f:text /r:share01 /u:julie.clay /p:Welcome1 | findstr "/user"
```
(Passing creds with search, usefull if you cracked a account)
or
Get-WinEvent -LogName security | where { $_.ID -eq 4688 -and $_.Properties[8].Value -like '*/user*'} | Select-Object @{name='CommandLine';expression={ $_.Properties[8].Value }}
(For the PWSH variant you need admin shell, group membership is not enough)
(PowershellOperationalLogs may also be checked cause it can contain hidden crednetials send in Script blocks etc)
