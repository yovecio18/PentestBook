When a service is installed, the registry configuration specifies a path to the binary that should be executed on service start. 
If this binary is not encapsulated within quotes, Windows will attempt to locate the binary in different folders. 
Take the example binary path below.
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64.exe
```
 Windows will attempt to load the following potential executables in order on service start, with a .exe being implied:
```
    C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64
```

1)Query for permissions:
```
sc qc SystemExplorerHelpService

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS
SERVICE_NAME: SystemExplorerHelpService
        TYPE               : 20  WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : System Explorer Service
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem	
```
2)We know that service get executed as System NT
3)If we inplant a exe into example:
```
    C:\Program.exe\
    C:\Program Files (x86)\System.exe
```
4)This should be able to invoke us a NT System but we need write intermissions on those path

### How to find for unquoted services?
```
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "auto" | findstr /i /v "c:\windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
```
