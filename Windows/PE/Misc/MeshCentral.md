## What is?
`MeshCentral` provides a centralized platform for managing multiple devices over the internet or a local network. It allows IT administrators to perform various tasks such as remote desktop control, file transfer, terminal access, and monitoring of devices.

## How do identify?
Just run NMAP and check the script result from port HTTPs.
```shell-session
nmap -p443 10.129.229.243 -sC -sV

```
*OBS:* It might be that in hardened environment that the access to the portal is blocked to specific hosts, in that case you have to look internally on the back-end or on the installed software list.

## How to attack?
If you can gain access to the portal via spoofed credentials then login.
Go to My devices.
Once we are within the device, we can select the `Terminal` tab and click `Connect` to establish a remote session with the target server.
