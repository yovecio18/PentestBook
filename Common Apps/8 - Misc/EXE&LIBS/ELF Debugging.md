1)`gdb ./file.elf`
(Open binary into Debugger)

2)`set disassembly-flavor intel`
(Set the display style of the code)

3)`run`
(dry rub of the app, I noticed otherwise is not poiting to right memory portion)

4)`display` 
(Shows all the functions)

5)`disasseble main`
(Disassembly the main function)

6)Find a juicy function ex: `0x0000555555555607 <+433>:	call   0x5555555551b0 <SQLDriverConnect@plt>`

7)break *ADDRESS ex break *0x5555555551b0
(Set a breakpoints at the call's address)

8)`run`
(This will run the binary in debug and stop at the breakpoints)

8)`info all-registers`
(This should unveil connection string and other juicy information stored in memory) 

OBS: You can sometimes archive this by just using stings together with binary and you may be able to get all strings if no obfuscation is on place.
Another alternative is to use Ghidra and disassembly the main function there in this case we would find the strings used to connect via SQL.
But beware of Endian encoding where all strings would have to be reversed.
