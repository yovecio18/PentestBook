# Introduction
### SunOS vs Solaris
They are the same, it started as SunOS before Oracle bought it and rename it as Solaris.

### Correlation
If you have SunOS 5.1 = Solaris10
(This mean you can get same documentation)


# Enumeration
### List current users permission 
`auths list`
(like 'sudo -l')

### For another username
`auths list -u username`

### Sudo as another username
`su - username`

### Password change
`passwd username`
(you need to have *solaris.passwd.assign* permissions)
