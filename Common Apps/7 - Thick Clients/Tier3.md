When you are handling 3 tier thick clients you have a AppServer in between you and the DB(Final step), this can intruduce some 
web attacks like SQLi, SSRF, etc.


### How to attack:
1. Set Wireshark listening in background
2. Try to run the java thick clients
3. Fetch all the hosts and port used
4. Add hosts to your hosts file if needed
5. Unzip the jar file 
6. Find the file with the port to edit ex: `ls fatty-client\ -recurse | Select-String "8000" | Select Path, LineNumber | Format-List`
7. Edit it to match the new connection port
8. Delete hashes from META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and 1.RSA and 1.SF files from the META-INF directory.
(The reason is because otherwise we won't be able to pack the application as it gets hashed and it would miss-match)

9. Pack the application back:
`cd .\fatty-client`
`jar -cmf .\META-INF\MANIFEST.MF ..\fatty-client-new.jar *`
10. You can decompile the application to code with JD-Gui: https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui
11. When the code is parsed you can export to source code by clicking on `File -- Save all Source`
12. Now you can play around and edit the code as you needed
