### Thick vs Thin
**Thin Client:** usually runs on a Remote server and you can access it thru a browser or client that does the wrapping.
All the storage and compute resides on the Remote server which makes it fully available everywhere but not that great a performing.

**Thick Client:** usually installed locally on the client and does majority of computing power, storage locally and eventually
sends the commits to/from remote server. This makes the process much faster.


### Types of Thick Clients
**2 tier:** Client installed locally and communicates to DB directly.
**3 tier:** Client installed locally and communicates first to an AppServer via HTTPS/HTTP which then it speaks to DB.


### Thick Client Analysis
1. Get Procmon64 from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/procmon
2. Monitor the app and check what does it exactly does
3. The client may drop some files in a temp folder
4. Locate it and change permissions to block deletions:
 `Properties -> Security -> Advanced -> cybervaca -> Disable inheritance ->` 
 `Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object ->` 
 `Edit -> Show advanced permissions, we deselect the Delete subfolders and files, and Delete checkboxes.`
 5. Now you can analyze those temp files
6. Download and run x64dgb
7. Options -> Preferences, and uncheck everything except Exit Breakpoint
8. Run the client in in to analyze the memdump
9. You can check under Memory Map and dump the event with protection RW. Then click Dump to Memory File
10. Use de4dot do de-obfuscate the memory portion
11. You may want to use strings to check for credentials: `strings64.exe .\restart-service_00000000001E0000.bin`
12. Or take it even further and use DnSpy to dissect the code if is a NET app.
