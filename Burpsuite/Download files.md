This guide explains how to download files as result of a request received via a Repeater session.

1. Send a request that will response back with a file in the response(aka download).
2. Copy the response locally via "Save to File" --> Important as it saves in Base64 encoding.
3. Run the script in the same folder to extrapolate the file and save it locally!
