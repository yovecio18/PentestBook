# How to replace a request in the header automatically before it get loaded into browser

Proxy>Options>Match and Replace
Add
	Type: Request header 	Since the change we want to make will be in the request header and not in its body.
	Match: ^User-Agent.*$ 	The regex pattern that matches the entire line with User-Agent in it.
	Replace: User-Agent: HackTheBox Agent 1.0 	This is the value that will replace the line we matched above.
	Regex match: True 	We don't know the exact User-Agent string we want to replace, so we'll use regex to match any value that matches the pattern we specified above.
