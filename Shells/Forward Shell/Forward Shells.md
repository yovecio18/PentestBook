This particular type of shell is useful if a firewall is blocking the traditional reverse shells.
This shell works with named pipes and write command to disk in order to gain a sort of interactivity.

# How to use?
I have a payload python in the folder, adapt it to your need to get a RCE. (In my case the command were executing via Authentication header JWT token)
Install:
https://github.com/n3rada/toboggan
Run to get the interactive shell: 
```
toboggan -m /PATH/TO/PYTHONSCRIPT -i
```
