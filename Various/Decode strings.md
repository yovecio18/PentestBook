If you may need a tool that can identify the encoding of a string in several steps i might suggest you to use this tool: https://github.com/s0md3v/Decodify
The feauture that is cool is that the tool performs all the decoding without stopping att the first one...

If this tool doesn't work try to decode all the steps as possible(ex from URL + from B64) and when you have a string that seems unknown and not
unencodable try to encode it to hex:
```
Start point: x+-N-²Ê(I*ÒÖEù9©VÅ%¥)©y%Ö%¹©VæFff¦¦
Encode to hex: 78 9c 2b 2d 4e 2d b2 ca 28 49 2a 05 d2 d6 45 f9 39 a9 56 c5 25 a5 29 a9 79 25 d6 25 99 b9 a9 56 86 e6 06 46 96 06 66 66 a6 a6 00 4e 03 0e 52
```
```
Take the first 3 bytes and check for magic bytes: 78 9c is ZLIB
```
Now you can use Cyberchef to enflate/deflate ZLIB!
